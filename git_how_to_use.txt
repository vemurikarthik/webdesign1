->GIT is a Distributed Version Control Sytem used to create repositaries which facilitate adding(checkin), pull out (checkout) , 
edit the files in the repository
->GIT is different from Native Version Control Systems(Local VCS)and Centralised Version Control Systems(CVCS)
->These are very useful because there is a backup all the time and also when working in a group/team, the changes committed to
one common file can be seen by every user and the changes can be applied to everyone using this file. It is not necessary
that locally one need to make changes to the file every time it is changed by others in the team. 
->Just checking it out is enough.
->There are few steps:
  Mapping the remote directories/files to a local location
  i.Change the directory to where it needs to be mapped.
  ii.Use the command git clone (clone url)
  
  If the origin master location(where u r committing the changes and also the place from where we are checking out) is not 
  accepted use the id name od git hub along with the url and change the origin name
  i.git remote set-url origin <new-url>
  
  Checking out the file from the repository into the local computer
  This can be done as follows:
  i.This is nothing but mapping 
  ii.Every time we map it and get all the files in the repository and use them
  
  Adding files to the index(staging)
  i.Using git add ., we add the files to the index implies we make it ready to commit
  
  Commit
  i.Using git commit, we commit all the changes that are made to the files in the repository
  ii.Using -m we can mention comments to the committed files 
  iii.This will only commit the changes in the local repository
  iv.Even though changes are made to the files later(after commit),when we push only committed files are pushed to the local 
  repository
  
  Pushing to the remote location:
  i.git push origin master pushes the files to the remote repository
